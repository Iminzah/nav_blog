    <p>Buju Banton in his recent interview with the Breakfast Club shared that "When you rent a house you cannot change the structure to fit your needs" Meaning you are forced to work with the structure and if you don't want,you leave.This is very true because the only thing you can do in this situation is to tune your needs to fit the structure you have at hand.In real life their is no time human needs will be satisfied fully. This is because we as human beings tend to complain a lot. If only we looked at the positive side of things then the world could be a far much better place than it is right now. We as humans are supposed to understand that we can use every opportunity we have to get something other than keep on complaining what is working and what is not working. There are some structures we have inherited from colonial and western culture.This structures have either affected us negatively or positively.Among the ones that affected us positively include Education and technology.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational.The western culture has brought about the aspect of gaining formal education and enlightening the lives of many.This has increased civilisation in the country thus the economic status of the country spikes up. This makes the lifestyle of many better especially in the marginalised areas.It has also brought about changes in the bad customs and beliefs for example Female Genital Mutilation</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Technology is another aspect that has been brought about by the western people. First, the evolution of technology is beneficial to humans for several reasons. At the medical level, technology can help treat more sick people and consequently save many lives and combat very harmful viruses and bacteria. The invention of the computer was a very important point. Communication is thus enhanced, and companies can communicate more easily with foreign countries. Research is also simplified. For companies, progress in implementing strategic technology trends is helping them save time and therefore, money. Exchanges are faster especially with the internet. Sales and purchases are now facilitated and possible worldwide. This allows businesses to buy raw materials with discounts or at reduced prices. Similarly, global tourism has grown.</p>

    <h2>Discrimination</h2>
    <p>The negative impact of western culture is discrimination.Discrimination based on skin color, also known as colorism or shadeism, is a form of prejudice or discrimination in which people who are usually members of the same race are treated differently based on the social implications which come with the cultural meanings which are attached to skin color. Today we define beauty by the lighter the skin the more the beautiful you are.Which is a wrong point of view.</p>
